Buildings marked as unsafe to occupy by the Cedar Rapids Fire Department following the 2020 derecho storms.

## About the data

A list of 140 buildings was released by the Cedar Rapids City Clerk's Office on August 19, 2020, in response to my public records request. The raw file is available at [input/PlacardProperties_19Aug0930.xlsx](https://github.com/palewire/cedar-rapids-buildings-unsafe-after-derecho-2020/blob/master/input/PlacardProperties_19Aug0930.xlsx). 

Using Python and the geocoding service at [geocod.io](https://geocod.io) I mapped the addresses. The results can be found in [output/placards.csv](https://github.com/palewire/cedar-rapids-buildings-unsafe-after-derecho-2020/blob/master/output/placards.csv) and [output/placards.geojson](https://github.com/palewire/cedar-rapids-buildings-unsafe-after-derecho-2020/blob/master/output/placards.geojson).

These files are public and free for any reuse. Attribution is appreciated.

The city official who released the data offered this cautionary note:

> The number of properties that are “unsafe to occupy” will change based on further inspections by certified building inspectors as well as work completed to mitigate the hazard such as removal of a tree or a professional contractor that has completed work to stabilize or fix the structure.
